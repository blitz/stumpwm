The Stump Window Manager
------------------------

StumpWM is a window manager written entirely in Common Lisp. It
attempts to be highly customizable while relying entirely on the
keyboard for input. You will not find buttons, icons, title bars, tool
bars, or any of the other conventional GUI widgets.

These design decisions reflect the growing popularity of productive,
customizable Lisp-based systems.

Build & Start StumpWM
---------------------

Prerequisites
=============

* a supported Common Lisp distribution. CLISP and SBCL both
  work. Other Lisp implementations may or may not work.

* CLX, the X bindings for Common Lisp.
* CL-PPCRE, the great regular expression library.

If you intend to use SBCL, you need to install portable-clx. If you
are using CLISP, make sure you use at least version 2.42 and that
CLISP is compiled with new-clx. As of CLISP 2.42, new-clx works fine
with StumpWM. Any version before that is too buggy to run StumpWM.

You can use ASDF-INSTALL to install Lisp libraries:
  $ SBCL
    * (require 'asdf)
    * (require 'asdf-install)
    * (asdf-install:install 'clx)
    * (asdf-install:install 'cl-ppcre)

If using CLISP, you will need to install asdf first to use
asdf-install.

  $ mkdir -p ~/.cl/asdf && cd ~/.cl
  $ wget http://cclan.cvs.sourceforge.net/*checkout*/cclan/asdf/asdf.lisp -O ~/.cl/asdf/asdf.lisp
  $ echo "(load #p\"/home/USER/.cl/asdf/asdf\")" >> ~/.clisprc.lisp
  $ mkdir -p ~/.cl/systems
  $ echo "(push #p\"/home/USER/.cl/systems\" asdf:*central-registry*)" >> ~/.clisprc.lisp
  $ wget http://common-lisp.net/project/asdf-install/asdf-install_latest.tar.gz
  $ tar xf asdf-install_latest.tar.gz
  $ ln -s ~/.cl/asdf-install/asdf-install/asdf-install.asd ~/.cl/systems/
  $ clisp
    * (asdf:operate 'asdf:compile-op 'asdf-install)
    * (asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op 'asdf-install)
    * (asdf-install:install :cl-ppcre)

Your operating system distribution may also have these libraries
available.

Building
========

Building StumpWM from CVS requires that you build the configure
script:

$ autoconf

If there's already a configure script then just run it.

$ ./configure

By default, StumpWM elects SBCL. If you have both installed, you can
explicitly select CLISP like so:

$ ./configure --with-lisp=clisp

If your Lisps are in strange places, you may need to tell the script
where to find them:

$ configure --with-sbcl=/home/sabetts/opt/bin/sbcl --with-clisp=/usr/local/downstairs/to/the/left/clisp

Now build it:

$ make

If all goes well, you should have a `stumpwm' binary now. Sorry, there
is no install yet. Just copy the binary wherever you want or run it
out of the stumpwm/ directory.

Now that you have a binary, call it from your ~/.xinitrc file:

$ echo /path/to/stumpwm >> ~/.xinitrc
$ startx

Hopefully that will put you in X running StumpWM!

SBCL
----

SBCL causes StumpWM to hang occasionally for some people. The problem
seems to be aggravated by using the modeline. You can use (load-module
"sbclfix") in your .stumpwmrc to workaround this problem.

Help
----

A Texinfo manual is available in stumpwm.texi. The build scripts
generate an info file you can read in emacs or with the `info'
program.

The StumpWM wiki at http://stumpwm.antidesktop.net/ is a great
resource for most problems.

See http://stumpwm.nongnu.org/community.html for more information on
contacting StumpWM developers and users.

There is a #stumpwm channel on irc.freenode.net, too.
